Questions:
* Should you re-estimate your estimates?
* Should we block a card and leave it when we need to wait weeks for a response?

* Should we fix bugs before working on new features?

* Should we handle bugs found in code not yet released differently than in code we have released?
* Should we create a card for something we already coded and tested?
