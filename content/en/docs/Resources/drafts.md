### Do this, not that,
* Pass individual parameters of simple type, instead of an object of type class.  Makes called function for re-usable and less entangled.
* Encapsulate all the external things
* Make static functions of oft repeated code
* Idempotent, don't change, functional programming
* Can I use this elsewhere in this class?  Can I use this elsewhere in this project?  Can I use this elsewhere in this solution?
* TDD - does it have to be testable?
