###### Security Demands
Software is used in almost everything of material value in our world today, and it is relied upon to protect that value against a world of hackers and adversaries that desire to cause harm.  The value of items protected by some software solutions is much different than the value of items protected by others.  Therefore, software developers benefit from different levels of controls, practices, and processes used during software development and in the resulting solution based on the value of the items the software may allow access to.  Software must correctly identify the user and determine their appropriate level of permissions.  Software must protect sensitive data collected from exposure.  Software must not allow unauthorized agents the ability to control machines and manipulate data.  Many of the protective measures are part of the software solution itself, but some controls must also be in place during the process of software development to prevent abuse.  The level of controls both within the software, and in the software development processes, varies across software solutions and needs to be evaluated for each solution to avoid the waste produced by implementing excessive security controls where they are not needed.
