###### Code
Like architecture, code, which in this context refers to both the computer language used to develop a solution and also the tools used to code that language, does not significantly affect many of the practices a software development team could implement.  Some development tools offer better support for integration with automated builds, project management tools, and other DevOps processes; and some provide better ability to write unit tests for the code than for others.  In addition, the steps to deployment are not the same for some languages, especially when comparing languages that need to be compiled to those that are just non-compiled scripts.  While the element of code doesnâ€™t greatly affect most practices, it is the single element about which every other element revolves.  The aim of every element is to help construct code to be implemented as part of the solution.
