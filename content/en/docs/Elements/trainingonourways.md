###### Training on Our Ways
An often overlooked topic of training for developers is training on all the elements of a company’s software development context including the processes by which software is developed, knowledge of the business domain, and a customer’s perspective of the value of the software solutions they help create.  Although software development processes usually are constantly evolving, most do so fairly slowly and could be documented and included in training programs for developers to help understand the software development life cycle (SDLC) of the team and how all the processes and tools are used to go from solution idea to delivered solution.  Understanding the full SDLC helps developers write software that improves the deployment, monitoring, and documentation of solutions.
