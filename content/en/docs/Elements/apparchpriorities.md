###### Application Architecture Priorities
We want all applications to be secure, fast, easy to use, and full of all the features customers need.  But every solution values one or two of these objectives more than others, and those values influence how the software is developed, and some of the practices that work best in facilitating that goal.  Some software solutions must be as secure as possible to prevent sensitive data leaks or to prevent undesired access to capabilities.  Other software solutions find it more valuable to deliver software quickly than to implement all the possible security features.  Some of the other application priorities include:
* 100% uptime.  Our solution must never be offline.
* Customer satisfaction.  We will do whatever it takes to please the customer(s).
* Ease of use.  Our software needs to be really easy to use by anyone without training or documentation.
* Fast.  Our software needs to eke out as much computing power as possible when running on the best hardware and networks.
* Our software needs to process an enormous amount of data quickly.
