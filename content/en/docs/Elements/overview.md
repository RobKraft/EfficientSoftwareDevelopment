### The Elements of a Software Development Context

There is more to software than code.  Software is used to provide a solution to a problem, meet a need, or fulfill a desire.  The goal is to meet that need or solve that problem, not to write code.  Code is just one part of the solution.  Getting the requirements right is another.  Quality assurance processes are important too.  Documentation and support may greatly add to or improve the value of what is delivered.  There are many elements that impact the production of software, and that is what the term elements refers to on this site.  

Elements are all the things that contribute to and affect the software that is eventually delivered.  

The elements are different from one organization to the next.  The elements are often different for teams within the same organization.  The set of elements for a particular software solution can be referred to as the Software Development Context.  The Software Development Context for one solution may use an agile process, while the Context for another solution uses a waterfall process.  The Context for one solution may use the Java language for the code, while the Context for another solution uses C++.  

All of the differences, some minor and some significant, imply that software solutions are developed in different contexts.  This is important to be aware of because it follows from that premise that every software solution may not benefit the same by adopting the same practices and processes.  For decades many software practicioners have looked for practices that greatly improve the efficiency of software development.  Some practices that frequently meet with success are Agile, unit tests, and automated DevOps.  Some that have less adoption are TDD and CI/CD.  The reasons for the success or failure is often not that the practice was implemented poorly, but rather than the practice is just not the right fit for that context.

Much of this site examines the software development contexts hoping to help you realize what practices will work in your context, and what practices won't.

Software Development Contexts vary substantially.  Just as there are few "engineering" best practices, rather there are best practices in each sub-discipline such as "building expansion bridges", "building dams", "building skyscrapers".  Likewise, we should expect different best practices in different software contexts.
