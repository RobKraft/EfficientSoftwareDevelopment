### Environment
The element of the software development context that may be easiest to improve is the developer’s environment, especially in cases where the developer has suggested changes they feel could make them more productive.  If a faster computer or faster Internet access can improve development speed by five percent it is probably well worth the minor cost to invest in better hardware and services.  Many developers now expect two or three monitors.  Spending a few hundred or a few thousand dollars on software development tools that shave minutes or hours of time from each developer’s day are probably also great company investments.  Comfortable chairs, desks, and spaces without distractions in which they can spend a lot of time in deep thought without interruption are often very beneficial and desirable.  Some developers may prefer to spend a lot of time closely paired.  Of course the home environment, where many developers work, also needs consideration.  Companies will find that by helping their developers obtain a great environment contributes to the employee’s morale, productivity, and the quality of their work.
