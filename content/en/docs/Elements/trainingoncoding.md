### Training on Coding and languages and development tools
Experienced developers are a valuable asset to any team, but the tools, languages, processes, and practices of software development continue to improve and every person likely can benefit from learning and mastering new language features, tools, and practices.  Companies have long recognized that software developers require ongoing training to stay abreast of where technology is headed and help evolve their software so that it can endure long into the future.  Providing opportunities for developers to learn new things and improve their skills not only leads to better software solutions, but also usually increases the morale and job satisfaction of the employees.
