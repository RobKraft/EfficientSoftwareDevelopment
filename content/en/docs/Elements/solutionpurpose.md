###### Solution Purpose
One aspect of software development teams that produces a large variance in which practices work best compared to other software development teams is the people that will use the software.  For some teams, solutions are used by other employees in the company.  Some teams write software that gets deployed and used by a group of paying customers.  Some teams write software for use by the general public.  Some teams write software that is used by a single client.  Some teams write software that is only used for a few months then discarded.  Some teams write mission critical software that keeps a business running.  Some teams write software for internal use by the company but the software is not critical and used only occasionally.  In each of these different contexts, that which constitutes a best practice is likely to be different, yet these are all teams developing software.
In addition to the general differences in solution purpose between companies, the purpose of solutions within a company may deviate from their normal purpose.  When developers need to experiment with a new programming language or technology, it may be best to expect that some of the usual processes followed during the SDLC are altered.  The same is true when an application is a prototype, or when a junior developer is learning a new technology.  In some of these cases you may choose to forgo unit tests, secondary code reviews, security audits, or robust documentation, because such actions add waste to the process.
