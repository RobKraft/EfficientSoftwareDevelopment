### What is Kanban?
A

Code Quality:
When code quality is good, it is easier to make and deploy small changes that add product value independently, and Kanban supports deploying small changes very well.

#### What does ChatGPT think?
(May 2023)Hey ChatGPT: What are good contexts and bad contexts using Kanban for software development?
Kanban is a popular Agile methodology that emphasizes visualizing and optimizing workflow, and it can be effective in many contexts. However, there are also situations where it may not be the best choice. Here are some examples:

Good contexts for using Kanban:

1. Continuous delivery: Kanban can be particularly effective in environments where continuous delivery is important, such as software development teams that prioritize frequent, small releases over large, infrequent ones.
2. High-variability workloads: Kanban can be effective in environments with high-variability workloads where the amount and type of work varies from day to day. The flexibility of the Kanban system can help teams adapt to these fluctuations and manage their workload more effectively.
3. Collaborative environments: Kanban emphasizes collaboration and encourages team members to work together to identify and resolve issues. It can be effective in environments where collaboration is a key aspect of the team's work.

Bad contexts for using Kanban:

1. Teams with strict deadlines: Kanban is an iterative process that is designed to help teams improve their workflows over time. In environments where there is a strict deadline that must be met, a more rigid process may be required to ensure that the project is completed on time.
2. Projects with complex dependencies: Kanban may not be the best choice for software development projects with complex dependencies. In these cases, a more structured project management methodology may be needed to ensure that all dependencies are accounted for and that the project progresses smoothly.
3. Teams with no experience in Agile methodologies: Kanban is an Agile methodology, and as such, it can be difficult for teams who have no experience with Agile to implement. Teams that are new to Agile may want to start with a more structured methodology, such as Scrum, before moving on to Kanban.

Overall, Kanban can be an effective methodology for software development in many contexts, particularly those that prioritize continuous delivery and collaboration. However, teams should carefully consider their specific circumstances before deciding whether Kanban is the right approach for their project.
