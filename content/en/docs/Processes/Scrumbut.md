### What is Scrumbut?
Scrumbut refers to teams that adopt some Scrum principles but are not following all of them.  To Scrum adherents, Scrumbut is a defective form of Scrum (https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-scrumbut) that should be corrected.  But many teams end up doing Scrumbut because they find that a few of the core scrum practices, like retrospectives at the end of every iteration, or consistently sized iterations, or daily scrums, are a bit of a waste of time in their context.  It is possible that there are more teams using Scrumbut in the world than there are following Scrum to the letter.  And, in case you have not figured out where the name comes from, it comes from this response to team members when asked, "We are doing Scrum, but...".

### Why adopt Scrumbut?
Adoption of Scrumbut is usually not intentional.  Rather it comes from trying to follow Scrum for a while and discovering some Scrum practice just isn't right for your context.

### Why not adopt Scrumbut?
Some who practice Scrum believe your process is flawed if you deviate from Scrum.

### How does your context affect the probability that Scrumbut will add value to your process?
Because Scrumbut is really just Scrum with some minor deviations, the responses to all the questions regarding how your context affects Scrumbut are the same as the responses for the questions regarding Scrum.  Please see the [responses for Scrum](/docs/processes/scrum/).
