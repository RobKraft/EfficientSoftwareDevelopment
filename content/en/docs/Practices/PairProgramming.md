### What is pair programming?
Pair programming is the practice of two people, usually two coders, sitting together at a single computer to write code.

### How does your context affect the success will have with pair programming?
###### How does the *[Organizational Structure](/docs/elements/orgstructure/)* in your context impact the probability that you will have success with *Pair Programming*?

Organizations that focus more on team output instead of invididual output are naturally more supportive of pair programming.  Conversely, organizations that incent employees at the individual level will have more resistance to pair programming.  Staffing structures that rely on and reward specific areas of expertise may struggle to implement pair programming, as may organizations with matrix structures.  Teams that remain together for a long period will have more success with pair programming, partially because it takes time for each participant in pairs to understand how best to work together with a specific partner.  Both a company and a contractor are less likely to want contractors to pair unless the purpose of the pairing is to transfer skills to an employee.
