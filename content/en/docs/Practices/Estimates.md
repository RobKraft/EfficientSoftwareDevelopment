(May 2023)Hey ChatGPT: When should software developers estimate effort and when should they not?

Estimating effort is a common practice among software development teams and can be helpful in many situations. However, there are also times when it may not be necessary or may even be counterproductive. Here are some examples:

When to estimate effort:
1. Planning and prioritization: Estimating effort can be helpful when planning and prioritizing tasks. By understanding the effort required for each task, teams can prioritize tasks based on their impact and effort, rather than just their importance.
2. Setting expectations: Estimating effort can also be helpful when setting expectations with stakeholders. By providing an estimate of the effort required, stakeholders can better understand the timeline and resource requirements for a project.
3. Identifying bottlenecks: Estimating effort can be helpful in identifying potential bottlenecks in the development process. If a particular task or feature is estimated to require a significant amount of effort, it may be necessary to allocate additional resources or adjust the development timeline to prevent delays.

When not to estimate effort:
1. Small tasks: Estimating effort may not be necessary for small tasks that can be completed quickly and easily. In these cases, it may be more efficient to simply complete the task rather than spending time estimating the effort required.
2. Highly uncertain tasks: Estimating effort may not be effective for highly uncertain tasks that may require significant experimentation or research. In these cases, it may be better to break the task down into smaller, more manageable pieces or to use other methods of estimation, such as time-based estimates.
3. Emergencies or urgent tasks: Estimating effort may not be necessary or feasible for emergencies or urgent tasks that require immediate attention. In these cases, it may be more important to simply complete the task as quickly and efficiently as possible.

Overall, estimating effort can be a helpful tool for software developers when used in the right context. Teams should consider the size and complexity of the task, as well as the level of certainty and urgency, when deciding whether to estimate effort or use another method.
