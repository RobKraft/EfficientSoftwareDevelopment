### What are pull requests and peer reviews?
A


### How does your context affect the success you will have with peer reviews?
###### *1. How does the *[Organizational Structure](/docs/elements/orgstructure/)* in your context impact the probability that you will have success with *peer reviews*?
Does the org structure support this?
###### *2. How does the *[Development Team Culture](/docs/elements/devculture/)* in your context impact the probability that you will have success with *peer reviews*?
If team members do not get along well, expect peer reviews to exacerbate problems.  If individual output is praised over team output and product quality, expect resistance.
###### 3. How does the *[Hiring Process](/docs/elements/hiringprocess/)* in your context impact the probability that you will have success with *peer reviews*?
Are you hiring people willing to pair, or lone wolf personalities?  Skills for pairing?
###### *4. How does the *[Team Composition](/docs/elements/teamcomposition/)* in your context impact the probability that you will have success with *peer reviews*?
PR can be used to mentor junior developers and/or to improve code quality and to transfer knowledge of the software.  Juniors doing PR of other JRs without the goal of learning the software probably add little value by doing the PR.  Contractors that don't expect to be around for the life of the product may not PR well due to lack of investment in the outcome.
###### 5. How does the *[Training Provided on Code](/docs/elements/trainingoncoding/)* in your context impact the probability that you will have success with *peer reviews*?
Big impact

Big impact
###### 7. How does the *[Environment](/docs/elements/environment/)* in your context impact the probability that you will have success with *peer reviews*?
Maybe little impact on solo PRs, but for live group reviews a place that minimizes distractions is usually needed.
