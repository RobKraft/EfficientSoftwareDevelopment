If you are spending some of your time reading this, you are probably interested in trying to improve your ability, or your team's ability to deliver software.  Many practices are recommended to software development teams but it some may not work as well for your team as others based on your context.  This section reviews some the impact of software development context elements on the recommended best practices to provide you things to consider.

Don't assume that a recommended best practice is not right for your team because some element of your context will make it more challenging.  That may just mean that you should consider changing that element to facilitate the adoption of a best practice.
