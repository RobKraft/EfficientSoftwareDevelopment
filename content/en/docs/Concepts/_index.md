Welcome!  I hope you find some information of value to you and your software development team on this site.  I have been writing software and developing solutions based on software since the early 1980s.  I am very passionate about improving my own ability to solve problems using software.  I hope to share some of my experience with others through this site.

This site provides guidance and considerations for anyone that is part of a software development team and wants the team to become better at delivering software.  Ultimately, software development teams are attempting to take ideas and turn them into solutions that provide value to an organization.  A plethora of best practices and ideas and principles exist, but each will experience varying degrees of success depending on your organization and team's software development context.  Much of the content on this site is here to help you understand your context so you can choose practices that work best for your team.

Civil engineering industries are full of best practices, but the best practices for building a bridge for a railroad are not the same as those for building a footbridge in Yellowstone Park.  The best practices for building a highway in Los Angeles are different than the best practices for building a side street in Deerfield, Kansas.  Likewise, the best practices for buidling a high traffic web application like Amazon.com or Facebook.com are likely to be different than the best practices for building the software than runs on your Garmin watch, or the software behind the Windows application you develop to manage your small company's budget.  Your application's context greatly affects the processes and practices that will contribute to optimizing your software development processes.

If you are a traditional project manager, or Scrum master, or process improvement expert, or product manager, or software development team lead, this site probably offers guidance you can consider and adopt for your own efforts.
